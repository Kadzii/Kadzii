### A little about me 💬

I graduated from the Industrial School, majoring in <strong>IT technology, programming and web design.</strong> I'm not afraid to learn new things. I prefer working in a team more, but I can finish my work as an individual. I am a person who can keep a cool head even in stressful situations. I have very good communication skills, knowledge of English and Russian. After four years of studying and one year of experience in JavaScript, I learned to solve complicated problems in various projects, which gave me flexibility in finding the optimal solution.
